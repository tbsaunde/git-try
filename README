A very stupid git wrapper to perform try pushes

=== What Does Work ===
- git try "<try syntax>"
- git try <foo> where try.foo is a set git configuration variable.

=== What Doesn't Work ===
Everything else you might want from such a tool.

=== Defects ===
- It is assumed the remote to push try pushes to is named try.
- the index and work tree must be clean.
